# Todot, a simple React todo app

This React app and its development were a tool for me to learn front-end programming. The features include adding and deleting Todos, and swapping their places via the `react-beautiful-dnd` package.

# How to build and run

## Prerequisites

Before trying to run the app, ensure you have Node installed (v21, for example). Instructions can be found on the [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs) website.

## Build instructions

To run the app, clone or download [this repository](https://github.com/mietteinen/todot) on your machine. To clone the project, `cd` to a folder of your choosing and type:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mietteinen/todot.git
```

After this write `cd todot` and run `npm install`. This will install the dependencies for the project. Now the project can be run via `npm start`, which should open the browser.
